# Lightweight Java Game Library 3 Tutorial
This tutorial is for anyone who wants to get started with the new version of the
[Lightweight Java Game Library](http://www.lwjgl.org/).  
In the course of the tutorial we will use OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile for creating a
small game with shaders. For older hardware there will possibly be an OpenGL 2.1
version available.

For a table of contents you can look into the
[wiki of this repository](https://github.com/SilverTiger/lwjgl3-tutorial/wiki).

_Note that LWJGL3 is currently a work in progress, so the source code might
change due to new or changed functions._
